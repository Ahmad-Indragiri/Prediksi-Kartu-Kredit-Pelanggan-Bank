# Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction 🚀

Welcome to this project that dives into predicting **customer churn** in the credit card industry using machine learning!

Customer churn—when customers stop using a service—is a major challenge for banks and financial institutions. By accurately predicting churn, businesses can take proactive steps to retain valuable customers and reduce revenue loss.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build predictive models that determine whether a credit card customer is likely to **churn** (stop using their card) based on their profile and transaction history.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **35 features** capturing customer demographics, account details, and behavioral data  
- **4 categorical features** encoded using **One-Hot Encoding**  
- Target variable indicating churn status (Yes/No)

---

## 🔍 What’s Inside This Notebook?

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Understand the data distribution, detect missing values, and visualize key patterns.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Handle categorical variables with One-Hot Encoding and prepare features for modeling.

3. **Model Development:**  
   Train and tune two powerful classification models:  
   - **Logistic Regression**  
   - **Random Forest Classifier**

4. **Model Evaluation:**  
   Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

5. **Insights & Recommendations:**  
   Derive actionable insights from model results to help businesses reduce churn.
